Our second Rust workshop in Basel. This time it's about fullstack Rust. Writing you backend, and also your frontend in the rust programming language. 

For this workshop we will use [dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/), where you can write your front end completely rust. It also offers UI native for desktop and even for mobile apps.

We are going to build a fullstack web application with you. This will be a guided workshop, where we are going to build a shareable shopping list.
With this sample fullstack application, you can create, share and edit shopping lists with other people (e.g. your family or room mates).

Stay tuned!

If you like to attend RVSP [here](https://www.meetup.com/rust-basel/events/299933581/?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=share-btn_savedevents_share_modal&utm_source=link). As we only have place for 20 people, RSVP early! It will be in the [Markthalle](https://altemarkthalle.ch/) 200 meters from the SBB Basel Train Station.

See you there! :)

Best

Roland & Yasin
