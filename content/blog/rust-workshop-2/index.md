# DRAFT - Date is still in discussion

Our second Rust workshop in Basel. This time it's about fullstack Rust. Writing you backend, and also your frontend in the rust programming language. 

For this workshop we will use [dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/), where you can write your fullstack web application completely in rust. It also offers UI native for desktop and even for mobile apps.

So what does this workshop look like? Having the insights from our previous workshop, we will split the workshop into small digestible parts. The first part will be going through the parts we need for the hands on part, where we explain basic concepts of the dioxus framework. 

The second part will be a hands-on part, where we will build a web app, where you can log in with an oAuth procedure.

## Part 1

- Intro: Fullstack Frameworks - examples from e.g. Svelte - 15 min
- Components: Write your first re-usable component in dioxus - 60 min
- Stateful Components: How to have stateful components in dioxus - 20 min
- Requests: How to request things on the internet? - 20 min

## Part 2: Hands-on

In this part we will go through all parts needed, so you can login to your application and log out again. Therefore will will write a basic login form, with which you will request an oAuth access token to look in to your shopping list.


- Login-Form
- Forwarding Login to your auth handler 
- ... TBD
