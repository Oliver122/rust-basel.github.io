Our second Rust workshop in Basel. This time it's been about fullstack Rust. Writing your backend, and also your frontend in the rust programming language. 

For this workshop we used [dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/), where you can write your front end completely rust. It also offers UI native for desktop and even for mobile apps.

This time we build a fullstack web application with you. A guide book about the past workshop you can find [here](https://rust-basel.ch/fullstack-rust-workshop/).In the Workshop we build a shareable shopping list together.
With this sample fullstack application, you can create, share and edit shopping lists with other people (e.g. your family or room mates).

If you dont feel like recoding it yourself, you can also clone the finished Github repository [here](https://github.com/rust-basel/axum-dioxus-shopping-list).

If you like to attend future RVSP meetings you can find the them [here](https://www.meetup.com/rust-basel/).

See you next time! :)

Roland & Yasin
