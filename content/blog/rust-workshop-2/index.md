# Topic

Our second Rust workshop in Basel. This time it's been about fullstack Rust.
Writing your backend, and also your frontend in the rust programming language.
For this workshop we used [dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/), where you can write your front end completely rust.
It also offers UI native for desktop and even for mobile apps.

This time we built a fullstack web application with our attendees, where you can create, delete
shopping lists, as well as items in these shopping lists.

# Resources

The guidebook from the past workshop you can find [here](https://rust-basel.ch/fullstack-rust-workshop/). If you want to have the solutions for the guidebook from above - have a look [here](https://github.com/rust-basel/workshop-2).
The directories in the solution repository correspond to the chapter in the book (just in case you get stuck).

If you do not feel like recoding it yourself, you can also clone the finished Github repository [here](https://github.com/rust-basel/axum-dioxus-shopping-list). Note: This repo was created beforehand (As we learned dioxus there first hand ;>). So the last chapter in the solution differes from this solution and also might not be the most idiomatic rust code.

# The meetup itself

We had like 22 attendees in the Markthalle in Basel. Atmosphere was great - food was sponsored be Endress+Hauser - and the attendees learned something new. In total a successful meetup!
