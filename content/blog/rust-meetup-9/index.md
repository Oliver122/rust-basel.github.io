# Engaged rustaceans even during holiday time
We enjoyed interesting talks and even more interesting discussions thereafter at the 9th Rust Basel meetup on Tuesday, July 30th.
The event sponsored by [letsboot](letsboot.ch) featured three talks that delved into diverse aspects of Rust development.

Even though it was well over 30 degrees outside and everybody in Basel seems to be on holiday, 18 rustaceans found their way
to the lofty office building behind the famous hammering man.

Here's a small recap of the event:

## Hurl
Silen Locatelli delved into the power of API testing with Hurl, which can benefit a wide range of projects, even outside the Rust world.

## Tauri
Oliver Hässler introduced Tauri, a Rust framework for crafting elegant user interfaces by leveraging web technologies.

## libgit2
Roland Brand showed a devtool built with Rust and libgit2 for modifying source code file headers.

Passionate Rust developers used the opportunity to connect, share experiences, and learn from each other, and chat over a beer and pizza.
